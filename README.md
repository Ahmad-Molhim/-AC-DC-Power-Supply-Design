# 🔋 AC-DC-Power-Supply-Design

**Tools:** LTSpice, Breadboard, Analog Discovery 2

Designed and built a DC power supply that converts 120 V AC to a regulated 3 V DC output (±0.1 V) at 10 mA. The design incorporates a step-down transformer, full-wave rectifier, and capacitor-based filtering. Simulations in LTSpice guided performance optimization for voltage regulation and noise reduction. Practical challenges—such as ripple and voltage drops—were addressed through iterative testing and design refinement.
